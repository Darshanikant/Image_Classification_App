# Image Classification App Using EfficientNetV2B0
   ### N.B : Here i use EfficientNetV2B0 keras pretrained model you can use any other keras pretrained model yoou want
- This is a Machine Learning-based Image Classification App that uses the EfficientNetV2B0 model to classify images into different categories. It provides predictions based on the uploaded image, showing the top 5 predictions with confidence scores and identifying the most likely category.

## Features
- Image Upload: Upload an image (JPG, PNG, JPEG) from your device.
- Top 5 Predictions: Displays the top 5 predictions with the probability scores.
- Most Likely Prediction: Shows the most likely category for the image.
- Fast and Efficient: Processes images quickly with the EfficientNetV2B0 model pre-trained on ImageNet.
## Technologies Used
- Model: EfficientNetV2B0 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- Frontend: Streamlit (for interactive UI)
- Backend: TensorFlow, Keras (for image classification)
## Libraries:
- NumPy
- TensorFlow Keras Applications
- streamlit

## How It Works
- Image Upload: Upload an image to the app through the file uploader.
- Prediction: The app processes the image using the EfficientNetV2B0 model and predicts the top 5 possible categories.
- Display Results: It shows the most likely category with a confidence score.
## Next Steps
- Explore optimizations to improve classification accuracy.
- Add more categories or extend it to detect more types of images.
- Improve the UI/UX for a more seamless experience.
## Conclusion
This project has been a great learning experience in both image classification and machine learning. By using the EfficientNetV2B0 model, I've been able to build an app that can predict image categories efficiently and accurately. I look forward to improving this app by adding more features and further optimizing the model.

### Thank you for checking out my project, and I hope it inspires you to explore the power of machine learning and AI in real-world applications!
